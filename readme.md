## Version History

### v14
1. Installed Redux
   a. `bower install --save tur-nr/polymer-redux`
	 b. `npm install --save redux`
2. Ostensibly fixed (front-end) bug on `login-view.html`
   a. Implementing unidirectional data flow in sub views: `user-panel.html`, `user-panel.html`, `user-panel.html`
	 b. Dispatch (action) events containing `type` and `payload` properties per Redux paradigm
	 c. Cleared `input.value` locally in sub-element
	 d. Implemented state management tools per Redux without yet implementing `redux-store.html` proper
3. v15 TODO:
   a. Incrementally add automation to creation/hosting new client-facing features of future versions
	 b. Make the process easier to update/upgrade the app by running parallel test-lab version offline from live app
	 c. Explore upgrading to Polymer 2.0
	 d. Upgrade Firebase security rules
	 e. Explore implementing unidirectional data flow
	 f. Clean up dashboard

### v13
1. Decided not to fix: Fix console error by updating `iron-flex-layout.html` to implement `iron-flex-layout-classes.html`
2. Updated dependencies using `bower update` or `bower-update-all`
3. Attempted to fix logic bugs in `login-vew.html`.
   a. View could not refresh state if errors were made when user input wrong key, email, parent, etc.
	 b. Hack-solved the problem by reloading page with `location.reload();`
	 c. Will implement more robust solution by managing state with Redux (tur-nr/polymer-redux)
4. v14 TODO:
   a. Install Redux, attempt to fix bug by managing state
   b. Incrementally add automation to creation/hosting new client-facing features of future versions
	 c. Make the process easier to update/upgrade the app by running parallel test-lab version offline from live app
	 d. Explore upgrading to Polymer 2.0
	 e. Upgrade Firebase security rules
	 f. Explore implementing unidirectional data flow
	 g. Clean up dashboard

### v12
1. Renamed `*-page.html` to `*-view.html` to refelct the parlance of our times

2. Ran `polymer lint` and fixed lint errors except the following:
   a. Those in `bower_components/` directory
	 b. Those that implement a behavior. (e.g., `MyBehaviors.EmailCodingBehavior`)
3. Cloning this version to archive save in case `bower update` installs breaking changes from dependencies
4. v13 TODO:
   a. Fix console error by updating `iron-flex-layout.html` to implement `iron-flex-layout-classes.html`
   b. Update dependencies using `bower update` or `bower-update-all`
   c. Incrementally add automation to creation/hosting new client-facing features of future versions
	 d. Make the process easier to update/upgrade the app by running parallel test-lab version offline from live app
	 e. Explore upgrading to Polymer 2.0
	 f. Upgrade Firebase security rules
	 g. Explore implementing unidirectional data flow
	 h. Clean up dashboard

### v11
1. Cloned v10 to prevent overwrite by automated deployment tools (e.g., polymer-cli, gulp, etc.)
	 
### v10
1. Implemented data architecture and denormalized data structure for object store optimization
2. Installed networking module and logic including multiple path storage / denormalized data structure
3. Installed tabbed sub panels into main deal editor, complete with CRud functionality
   a. CRud = Create and Read (capitalized) only were tested / ud = lowercase... features not tested
4. Implemented denormalized data structure and CRud functionality for deal sub-editor (i.e., partial bid entity)
5. Prepped for deployment
   a. https://youtu.be/ByV3MWTa1fw | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByV3MWTa1fw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsII5c3Mgw6fNYCzaWrsM3sMN&index=1

	 c. Make the process easier to update/upgrade the app by running parallel test-lab version offline from live app
	 d. Explore upgrading to Polymer 2.0
	 e. Deploy proper Firebase security rules
	 f. Explore implementing unidirectional data flow
	 g. Clean up dashboard
